In my first ever trading blog post, I keep track of the thought process that lead me to short palladium. 

# Introduction 
The goal of this study is to find opportunities in trading some rare industrial metals. 
Palladium, Platinum and Rhodium are mainly used to reduce the pollution generated by automobiles. In the catalytic converter, they speed up the decomposition of harmful gases ejected by combustion engines. 
The production tonnage goes as [follows](http://www.platinum.matthey.com/documents/new-item/pgm%20market%20reports/pgm_market_report_february_2019.pdf):

* South Africa and Russia are the two main supplyers of the metals. For platinum and rhodium, supply is almost entirely dependant on South Africa. 
* For comparison, there is 10x less palladium mined per year than gold. 
* Given this relatively small and concentrated supply on one hand, and increasingly tight pollution regulations on the other hand, we expect the price of these commodities to be volatile. 

So, let's explore the past and current price action. 

# Individual price analysis

To profit from the market, we must find a commodity that is undervalued or overvalued and whose price will correct quickly. 
Let's look at the inflation-ajusted price to compare valuations over long time scales.

* Over the last 28 years, platinum prices varied (max/min ratio) by a factor 5, palladium by a factor 25, rhodium by a factor 50. We can expect to make money on rhodium and palladium, but hardly on platinum.
* Rhodium prices look stationary whereas palladium and platinum prices could be trendy (regression line in black). Hence, we will use different methods to assess how likely it is that a commodity is over or under-valued. 

To determine if the price of commodity is stretched with respect to historic valuations, we plot the price ratio with respect to median price (rhodium) and regression price (platinum and palladium).

* History of Bulls runs : [98-01] (pall,rhod); [02-08] (plat) and [04-08] (rhod), [2016-now] (pall, rhod). Previous bull runs lasted 3 to 6 years. The current one is in its 4th. 
* **Rhodium**: Current multiple (x9) at an all-time high, suggests the 4th bubble in 28 years. Unfortunately, I didn't find any Rhodium ETF, so I cannot short rhodium. 
* **Palladium**: Although historically high, the price multiple with respect to the long-term regression is only at half the level of 2001. 
* **Platinum**: Seems undervalued, but unfortunately platinum shows low volatility, especially to the upside. 

# Platinum-Palladium price ratio

Although palladium is prefered for petrol engines whereas platinum is mainly used in diesel engines, manufacturers could theoretically substitute one metal for another when prices ratios are too streched. Let's look at historic prices ratios between the two metals.

* pall / plat ratio is at an all time high ! It has recently showed signed of volatility (end 2019). 
* The ratio has spent 90% of time below 1, but it is now thre times higher. Is this a market anomaly that will be quickly corrected, or does this reflect the definitive death of diesel engines ? For all I know, commodity prices never reach the sky. 

# Price Variations

# Conclusion
Over the last 28 years, three main components of the platinum group metals have shown rapid price bubbles build up and burst: palladium (/6 after the 2001 burst), platinum  and platinum (/8 and /2, respectively, in 2008). 

Looking at multiples to historic prices and price ratios between elements of the metal groups, we showed that a third bubble is building for rhodium and palladium. 

[2020-04-03] : I started shorting rhodium the 2020/01/20 and I now sit with a potential 15% loss.
